new request
They want to meld the model and form factor columns into one column.
Also they want the form factor portion of that to be in a certain format as outline in the file CMDB Models_20171214.xlsx
Not quite sure how to proceed on that just yet nor what is requested exactly.


#Important notes:
# 12/16/2017: I removed the database SonicCorpSOEInfo from consideration as it appears to have been taken out of Kace
# I also added some other databases as they appear to have been added in....I will ask which of these need to stay

I kept getting this error when runnign the program using the batch file bat file:
"Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the server or shared resource and try again"
I tried creating a net connection with:
net use \\ussighnynt12.us.int.sonichealthcare\imports /user:us\sitkace Austin123
I'd get that error. this was even when I did this:
net use \\ussighnynt12.us.int.sonichealthcare\imports /delete /y

So I went to the swcausfsv02 server and did "net use \\ussighnynt12.us.int.sonichealthcare\imports /delete /y" there and it fixed it.
So I added net use \\ussighnynt12.us.int.sonichealthcare\imports /delete /y at the beginning of the batch file to delete any connections there in case.
So I added the delete line at the beginning of the batch file as well
