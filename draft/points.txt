new request
They want to meld the model and form factor columns into one column.
Also they want the form factor portion of that to be in a certain format as outline in the file CMDB Models_20171214.xlsx
Not quite sure how to proceed on that just yet nor what is requested exactly.


#Important notes:
# 12/16/2017: I removed the database SonicCorpSOEInfo from consideration as it appears to have been taken out of Kace
# I also added some other databases as they appear to have been added in....I will ask which of these need to stay
